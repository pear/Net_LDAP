UTF8 and Net_LDAP:

It is hard to know exactly what entries need utf8 every time you need them,
so here's the simple way to salvation:

Net_LDAP will check internally if utf8 is needed.

Code:
$attrs = $ldap->utf8Encode( $attrs ); // now the attributes have been encoded.
$entry->add ($attrs) ; // add attributes to the entry.

$attrs = $entry->attributes();
$attrs = $ldap->utf8Decode($attrs); // the other way around

Thanks to Jan for the code.
