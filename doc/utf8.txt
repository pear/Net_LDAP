UTF8 and Net_LDAP:

It is hard to know exactly what entries need utf8 every time you need them, so here's the simple way to salvation:

Use Net_LDAP_Util!
The class will check if utf8 is needed.

Code:
$util = new Net_LDAP_Util($ldap); // $ldap is your base ldap object.
$attrs = $util->utf8Encode( $attrs ); // now the attributes have been encoded.

$entry->add ($attrs) ; // add attributes to the entry.
             
Thanks to Jan for the code.
